# Linamp
Linamp is not a monitoring app


Linamp is currently in pre-production state.
It has been decided that the first prototype would be written in python, for the sake of saving time.
Once Linamp runs on the main target platforms, a new build, in whatever the preferred language for each os is, will be released.

(As of now, Nothing to see here)
